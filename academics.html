	<p>In the begging of the symester I started with 6 classes and one free period. My schedule was first period Honors English, second period World History, third period APCSP, fourth period Math Analysis, fifth period Honors Physics, sixth period free, and seventh period Honors Spanish. Quickly I realized that this schedule was too much for me to handle and maintain for the rest of the schoolyear so I dropped out of honors spanish and instead had both a free sixth and seventh period. After experiencing two free periods for one symester I decided that I should challenge myself by taking another class for second symester, so I added sixth period Film as Literature. Overall, I have enjoyed the classes that I enrolled in for Junior year of highschool. My favorite classes have to be Honors English and suprisingly, Film as Literature.</p>
