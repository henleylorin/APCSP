	<p>This year I got the privelege of playing on the Piedmont Girls Lacrosse team. Although we did not end up on top, I had an amazing experience on the team this year and I cannot wait to play again next year to improve my skills and get to know this amazing group of people better!</p>

           <p>In October of 2023 I started my cake baking business called Butter and Sugar with my bussiness partner and friend Amy Derr. We bake cakes and cupcakes out of our home and are very proud of our success thus far and cannot wait to start new projects this summer and at the start of the next school year.
